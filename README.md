# Eye Movement Effect

This project creates a simple eye movement effect using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## How it Works

The `index.html` file contains the basic structure of the webpage. It includes two `<div>` elements styled as eyes inside a main `<div>` container. The `style.css` file provides the styling for the eyes and the background.

The JavaScript code in the `index.html` file uses the `mousemove` event listener to track the mouse movement. It calculates the position of the mouse relative to the center of each eye and adjusts the rotation of the eye accordingly, creating a subtle "following" effect.

## Usage

To use this project, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Move your mouse around the screen to see the eyes follow your cursor.
